All data is already processed. You can access anything anywhere in the code as long as you have loaded it in with one of the pieces of code present in the notebooks. 
The following order is required to do it all over:
First, "analysis of tweets.ipynb" should be run.
Second, "Putting everything together.ipynb" should be run.
This will result in two final csv files: "Final starters.csv" and "Final workforce.csv". These were used for the analysis in SPSS. 
First both files were transformed to excel to normalize the data. After that they were imported into SPSS. The data and outputs of SPSS are in "DATA/SPSS". 
The results are also summarized in the "Descriptive statistics.xlsx" file.
